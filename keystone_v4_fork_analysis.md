## Component Relationships

### List Registration and Field Integration

1. Lists are registered through the `List` constructor

   - Each list is associated with a Keystone instance
   - Lists can inherit from other lists (single inheritance)
   - Lists maintain their own schema and field definitions
   - Lists handle their own data operations

2. Field Integration
   - Fields are added to lists through the `add` method
   - Each field type extends the base field functionality
   - Fields are processed through the UpdateHandler
   - Fields can have their own validation rules
   - Fields manage their own data transformation

### UpdateHandler Interaction

1. Data Processing

   - UpdateHandler processes data updates for lists
   - Handles field validation and processing
   - Manages file uploads and relationships
   - Provides error handling and validation feedback
   - Manages data transformation

2. Field Processing
   - Validates field data against defined rules
   - Processes file uploads for file fields
   - Handles relationship updates
   - Manages required field validation
   - Provides field-specific processing

### View System Integration

1. Data Access

   - Views can access list data through queries
   - Supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations
   - Manages template rendering and data preparation
   - Provides data transformation utilities
   - Handles data caching

2. Queue Management
   - Maintains separate queues for different operations
   - Handles initialization, actions, queries, and rendering
   - Provides flexible view customization options
   - Manages operation priorities
   - Handles error recovery
