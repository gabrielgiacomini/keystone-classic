# TypeScript Type Naming Convention

## Rules for Type Naming

1. All type names MUST start with the prefix `KS`
2. After the prefix, the type name should be constructed by:
   - Taking the full path from the root directory
   - Converting all directory separators to PascalCase
   - Removing any file extensions
   - Converting the entire path to PascalCase

## Examples

For a file at `src/fields/types/boolean/BooleanType.ts`:
```typescript
type KSFieldsTypesBooleanBooleanType = {
  // ... type definition
};
// Suggested name: KeystoneBooleanField (simpler and more maintainable)
```

For a file at `src/fields/types/relationship/RelationshipType.ts`:
```typescript
type KSFieldsTypesRelationshipRelationshipType = {
  // ... type definition
};
// Suggested name: KeystoneRelationshipType (simpler and more maintainable)
```

## Important Notes

- The naming convention is strict and must be followed exactly
- While the full path-based naming is possible, it's recommended to use simpler, more maintainable names
- Always add a comment with the suggested simpler name below the type definition
- The prefix `KS` is mandatory and must be capitalized
- All parts of the name should be in PascalCase
